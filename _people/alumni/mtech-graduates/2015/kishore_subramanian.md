biography_paragraphs:
  - "I am a biomedical signal processing professional with experience in developing medical device algorithms from inception. As the first employee at Sattva MedTech, I was solely responsible for the end-to-end design and development of the fetal ECG monitoring algorithm, building the complete signal processing pipeline from the ground up within an early-stage startup. The algorithm subsequently achieved CE certification, demonstrating its technical soundness and clinical readiness."
  - "Currently, I work on cardiac diagnostic solutions, including 12-lead ECG, single-lead ECG, and Holter monitoring systems. My work focuses on developing and validating algorithms for the detection of clinically critical arrhythmias, such as second- and third-degree heart block, atrial fibrillation and flutter, and atrial enlargements."
  - "In addition to algorithm development, I have been actively involved in the Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) regulatory process, contributing to successful CDSCO certification by aligning algorithm design, validation, and documentation with regulatory requirements."
  - "My primary interests lie in applying advanced signal processing techniques to medical and healthcare applications, with an emphasis on clinically reliable, regulatory-compliant solutions."

biography_paragraphs:
  - "Currently pursuing an M.Tech in Signal Processing at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), I am deeply passionate about signal processing, image processing, computer vision, and deep learning. My current thesis focuses on Neuromorphic Super-Resolution Radar, an interdisciplinary area that integrates event-based sensing, high-resolution imaging, and intelligent signal reconstruction. I am particularly interested in bridging classical signal processing techniques with modern neural architectures to develop efficient, scalable, and perceptually intelligent systems."
  - "I completed my B.Tech in Electrical Engineering from Jadavpur University, after which I worked at NTPC Limited for over two years as an Operation Engineer."
